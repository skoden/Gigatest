To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of every GigaTest.com and its subsidiaries' web pages.</p>
								
                                <h4>What information we collect:</h4>
								<p style="text-indent:30px">On some GigaTest web sites, you can order products or services, download software updates, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information. In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of GigaTest products.</p>
								
                                <h4>How we use the information:</h4>
								<p style="text-indent:30px">GigaTest uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, and to personalize our web sites for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.</p>
								<p style="text-indent:30px">From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such contact. Please follow the opt-out directions given below in the "Choice" section of this document. In addition, we will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt-in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable.</p>
								
                                <h4>Whom we share the information with:</h4>
								<p style="text-indent:30px">GigaTest will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other GigaTest entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such GigaTest entities and/or business partners are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements.</p>

                                <p style="text-indent:30px">GigaTest will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you wish to opt-out of partial or all contact from GigaTest and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. This choice may be offered at the bottom of on-line or off-line communications from us as well as on many of our web registration pages.

GigaTest has not reviewed all of these third party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their privacy policies. Thus, GigaTest does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them.

                            <h4>How GigaTest Uses Cookies</h4>
							<p style="text-indent:30px">A cookie is a piece of text asking permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. If you agree, then your browser adds the text in a small file. The purpose of a cookie is to help us analyze web traffic or let us know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs likes and dislikes.</p>
							<p style="text-indent:30px">A few GigaTest.com web sites use temporary cookies as part of the customer web navigation experience, tracking unique IDs for that particular web site session only. This cookie, by itself, only tells us that a previous GigaTest.com visitor has returned. If you deny the cookie, you can still use the site anonymously. Certain GigaTest web sites use cookies to provide an automated log-in process for previously registered customers. This insures that you will be accurately identified and linked with your registration data. A cookie may also be placed on your computer to ensure you are not surveyed multiple times during your visit(s) to an GigaTest web site. This cookie has a limited life span and will not personally identify you.</p>
							<p style="text-indent:30px">Overall, cookies help us give you a better web site to use, by letting us monitor what's working and what isn't through site traffic analysis. GigaTest wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. We know that a lot of people have concerns about cookies, but in talking with many of our customers, we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have with our customers, so we respect these concerns. GigaTest works to continuously improve the GigaTest.com web experience and personal data privacy policy and practices.</p>
							<p style="text-indent:30px">You may set your web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscap Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely. You can delete the files that contains cookies; those files are stored as part of your internet browser.</p>
